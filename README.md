# Hello World!

Hello!  This is my first GitHub project.  I know a little bit of around 10 programming languages.  I am currently working on editing the BungeeSuiteChat plugin to work with 1.9.  Probably won't work though.

Update 1/18/22, almost 6 years later:
I've come so far, lol! I have 36 repositories on my account. I mostly work in Java. My current project is UltraCosmetics, a cosmetics plugin for Spigot in need of care and cleanup.
Also, this commit is to test key signing :)
